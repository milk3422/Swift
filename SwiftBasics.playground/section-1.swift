// Comments can be single line comments

/* Or they can be many
many
many lines.
/* and they an be nested as well */
*/

// Print things to STDOUT
println("Hello World")

/***********
* Variables
***********/

// A variable (The type is inferred)
var str = "Hello, playground"
str = "Change the value"

// A constant (Type inferred)
let aConstant = 42

// Assigning a constant a new value will give you an error
//aConstant = 54

// Multiple variables can be assigned on a single line
var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0

// NOTE: If a value is not going to change, declare it using the 'let' keyword

// Explicitly define variable using type annotation
var explicitInt: Int
let explicitDouble: Double = 3.14

// Multiple variables can be set on a single line with the type after the final
// variable
var red, green, blue: Double

// Unicode characters can be used as variable names
let √º = "Umlat"
let üê∂ = "Dog"

// Values are not implicitly converted, they must be explicitly converted
let label = "The width is "
var width = 95
var widthLabel = label + String(width)

// A simple way to convert values is to use the \() operator
var simpleWidthLabel = "The width is \(width)"
var concatWidthLabel = "The width is: " + String(width)

/***********
* Semicolons
***********/

// Semicolons are not required after statements but are required for multiple
// statements per line
let cat = "üê±"; println(cat)

/*********
* Integers
*********/

// Ints are available in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit signed and unsigned forms
let eightBitInt: Int8 = 42
let sixtyFourUInt: UInt64 = 72342

// Bounds can be accessed with min and max properties
let minIntValue = UInt16.min

// Using 'Int' creates a type the same size as the systems native word size
// ie. On a 64-bit platform, Int is the same as Int64
// On a 32-bit platform, Int is the same as Int32
// UInt follows the same convention

/***********************
* Floating Point Numbers
***********************/

// Floating point numbers are numbers with a fractional component
// i.e., 3.14159 or -1.2345

// Swift provides two tipes of floating point numbers:
// Floats which are 32-bit
// Double which are 64-bit
let aFloat: Float = 3.14159
let aDouble: Double = -1.23455

// Double has a percision of at least 15 decimal Digits, and Float has as few
// as 6 digits

// Note: Swift chooses a Double instead of a Float if no type is specified

/*****************
* Numeric Literals
*****************/

// Integers can be different types.
// decimal type has no prefix
// binary type has a prefix of '0b'
// octal type has a prefix of '0o'
// hexadecimal type has a prefix of '0x'
let decimalInt = 42
let binaryInt = 0b101010
let octalInt = 0o52
let hexadecimalInt = 0x2A
